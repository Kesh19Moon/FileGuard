"Because your files deserve a superhero"

FileGuard is a next-gen file manager and encryption tool designed to protect your files from prying eyes, careless coworkers, and that one friend who ‚Äúborrows‚Äù everything on your laptop.

Features

Secure Storage: AES-256 encryption keeps your files safe‚Äîeven from the nosiest intruders.

Password-Protected Sharing: Share files safely; recipients need the correct password (sorry, no magic backdoors).

Traceable Access: Know who accessed what, when, and how‚Äîperfect for keeping digital receipts.

Cross-Platform: Works on Windows and Linux (Mac version in the works‚Ä¶ because why not?).

Web Interface: Upload, manage, and encrypt files from your browser‚Äîdrag, drop, done!

Why FileGuard?

Because your files deserve more than ‚Äújust a folder.‚Äù FileGuard is like giving your documents a digital bodyguard, minus the sunglasses and earpiece.
